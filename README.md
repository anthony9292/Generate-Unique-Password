# Your-password

<p> With this project i was stumbling to figure out the layout for it. i was confused at the beginning with how i how i was going to build it. i ran threw multiple designs as u can see from my github and decided to mix and match at the end.</p>

****challenges I faced***

1. Page layout and how i wanted to present the password generator 
2. Windows alert method would not work smoothy on chrome so had to find other method
   ----problem arose when i was playing around with alert method,  chrome would freeze up on input of numbers and symbols.
3. Had Challenges trying to display the generated password in java
4. Had Challenges trying to figure out the copy to clipboard function in java 
5. Had challenges trying to work out how to add on click events(used google)
6. Had challenges trying to figure out what was best to use getElementById or querySelector for this project.
7. Was getting confused with the Math(Math.floor(Math.radom()))part of the code in java so used google to find a simpler way to code it.(was getting lost in the code).
